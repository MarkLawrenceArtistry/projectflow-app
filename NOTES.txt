there is something wrong with development status I changed the color of one card then the first card was duplciated with that third card

finished tab is not working 

why is a member can still operate and manage? they can only view, in tasks its differnet they can check but they cant delete their tasks assigned to them

and also where is the dashboard for leader/admin, in the initial version when you click the card of member(if you are admin/leader) you can see their tasks completed and if theyre fair/great/medium performance
